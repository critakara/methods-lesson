# Create a program block_function.rb.  It should have a function do_calc that calls a
# block using a yield statement.  The yield statement will pass the numbers 7 and
# 9 to a block, and then will print out the result.  Call the do_calc function twice in your program. The first time, pass a block that adds the two numbers. The second time,
# pass a block that multiplies the two numbers.  Your program should print out 16 and 63.   


def do_calc # yield just acts as a blind return? what is this for? for classes i assume?
  result = yield(7,9)
  puts result
end

do_calc do
  |a,b| a+b
end

do_calc do
  |a,b| a*b
end
